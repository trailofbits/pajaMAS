    <p>Cloud computing platforms have revolutionized modern software development by providing scalable infrastructure on demand. Companies can now deploy applications globally without maintaining physical servers, reducing both costs and complexity.</p>
    
    <p>Machine learning workloads benefit significantly from cloud resources, as they can leverage powerful GPU clusters for training large models. This democratizes access to advanced AI capabilities that were previously only available to large technology companies.</p>
    
    <p>The adoption of containerization technologies has simplified application deployment across different environments. Docker and Kubernetes have become industry standards for packaging and orchestrating applications in cloud environments.</p>
